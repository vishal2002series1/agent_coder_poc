  **Role**: As a {language_name} tester, create RELAXED test cases for the following requirements.

  **Target Language**: {language_name}
  **Test Framework**: {test_framework}
  **Requirements**: {requirements}

  **IMPORTANT - RELAXED TESTING APPROACH**:
  - Focus ONLY on verifying that code executes without errors
  - DO NOT check for specific output values or mathematical precision
  - Use basic assertions like "not null", "not empty", or "no exceptions thrown"
  - The goal is to ensure the code runs on client systems, not functional correctness

  **Test Categories**:

  **1. Basic Execution Tests**:
  - Call each function with typical inputs
  - Verify the function returns something (not null/undefined)
  - Ensure no exceptions are thrown during normal execution

  **2. Edge Case Execution Tests**:
  - Test with edge inputs (empty, zero, negative values)
  - Verify the code handles these without crashing
  - Check that functions return some result (any result is acceptable)

  **3. Integration Tests**:
  - Test that different functions can be called together
  - Verify the overall program flow executes without errors

  {specific_instructions}

  Please provide test cases wrapped in {code_marker} blocks.
  Focus on EXECUTION SUCCESS, not output correctness.

test_designer_instructions_python: |
  **RELAXED PYTHON TESTING RULES**:
  - Use try-except blocks to catch any exceptions
  - Check for basic conditions like "result is not None"
  - Print success/failure messages instead of strict assertions
  - Example:
  ```python
  def test_function():
      try:
          result = function_name(input_value)
          assert result is not None, "Function should return something"
          print("PASS test_function passed")
      except Exception as e:
          print(f"FAIL test_function failed: {e}")
  ```

test_designer_instructions_java: |
  **RELAXED JAVA TESTING RULES**:

  - Assume the primary implementation logic is within a single public class (e.g., named 'Solution' or a domain-relevant name like 'FileProcessor').
  - When calling methods from the implementation, always invoke them statically on the primary class (e.g., Solution.methodName(args) or FileProcessor.methodName(args)). Use 'Solution' as the class name in your tests if no other obvious name is inferred from the requirements.
  - Create separate public static void test methods for each logical function/user story.
  - Ensure all necessary Java import statements are at the top of the test file (even if they are standard Java libs).
  - Use try-catch blocks to handle any exceptions that might occur during the test method execution.
  - Check for basic conditions like "result != null" or "list.isEmpty() == false".
  - Print clear success/failure messages for each test.
  - DO NOT check for specific output values or complex logical correctness.
  - DO NOT use JUnit annotations or imports. Focus on runnable code in a main method in the test class.

  **IMPORTANT FOR EXTERNAL INTERACTIONS (Files, APIs, Databases)**:

  - DO NOT attempt to open/read/write actual files on the filesystem. Instead, simulate file operations by:
    - Passing String content instead of file paths to methods.
    - Using StringReader or ByteArrayInputStream to mock file content if BufferedReader or InputStream is expected.
    - Asserting that file creation or closure methods execute without exceptions.
  - DO NOT make actual network calls to external APIs. Instead, simulate API responses by:
    - Passing mock JSON strings to parsing methods.
    - Having the test methods return predefined mock data if an API call is expected.
  - DO NOT connect to or query real databases (e.g., MongoDB). Simulate database interactions by:
    - Passing dummy data structures (e.g., Map<String, String>) instead of database results.
    - Asserting that database update methods execute without exceptions.

  The goal is to verify the internal logic and integration points, not the external system's availability.

  **Example of a test method structure**:

  ```java
  public class RelaxedJavaTests { // This is the main test class
      public static void testOpenRequiredFiles() {
          try {
              // Simulate file input/output by making the method accept mock objects 
              // or by not actually interacting with filesystem.
              Map<String, java.io.BufferedReader> mockFiles = new java.util.HashMap<>(); // FQN for clarity
              // Example: Solution.openFiles(mockFiles); // If openFiles accepts Map
              System.out.println("PASS: testOpenRequiredFiles - assumed successful execution with simulated environment.");
          } catch (Exception e) {
              System.out.println("FAIL: testOpenRequiredFiles - " + e.getMessage());
          }
      }
      
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          testOpenRequiredFiles();
          // Call other test methods here
      }
  }
  ```

test_designer_instructions_csharp: |
  **RELAXED C# TESTING RULES**:

  - Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions
  - Check for basic conditions like "result != null"
  - Print success/failure messages
  
  **Example**:
  ```csharp
  static void TestFunction() {
      try {
          string result = FunctionName("input");
          if (result == null)
              throw new Exception("Function should return something");
          Console.WriteLine("PASS TestFunction passed");
      } catch (Exception e) {
          Console.WriteLine($"FAIL TestFunction failed: {e.Message}");
      }
  }
  ```

# === ProgrammerAgent Prompts ===
programmer_agent_base_java: |
  You are an expert Java programmer. Generate a complete, runnable Java program that satisfies the following requirements and passes all the provided tests.

  **REQUIREMENTS**:
  {requirements}

  **TESTS TO PASS** (for context, do not replicate in your code):
  {tests}

  **IMPORTANT JAVA REQUIREMENTS**:

  - Your main implementation class should be named 'Solution' (or a name highly relevant to the primary requirement, e.g., 'CustomerAccountProcessor'). Use 'Solution' as a default if no obvious domain name is present.
  - The code MUST be enclosed in a public class.
  - If the requirements describe a core process or a single main operation, ensure it's encapsulated in a public static method (e.g., public static void main(String[] args) if it's an executable program, or public static ReturnType methodName(Parameters) if it's a utility function expected by tests).
  - Always include all necessary import statements at the top of the file.
  - Use the exact same field names and data structures as shown in the tests.
  - Generate clean, well-documented implementation code.
  - Ensure the class name and method signatures you define are consistent with how the tests would invoke them.
  
  **NOTE**: Generated code should not contain any test cases.
  **NOTE**: Use dependencies supported by Maven Central only. Do not use any other libraries or frameworks.
